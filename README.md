This is my Data Science Portfolio, where I do all my AI work, such as:

Drone Racing Challenge: Used edge detection to detect arrows so the robot could follow them.

Portfolio 1: Basic cleaning on an e-commerce dataset.

Portfolio 2: Running logistic and linear regression on an e-commerce dataset.

Portfolio 3: Clustering and KNN.

Portfolio 4 (Cardiovascular Disease Prediction): Implemented a machine learning algorithm to predict cardiovascular disease.

AI Disaster Response: Applied genetic algorithms to help a town organize its tools for disaster management.

COMP3410 Assignment 1: Implemented Iterative Depth Search (IDS) to solve problems.

Solar: linear regression on some real, aggregated time series data

This portfolio showcases my journey in AI, machine learning, and data science projects.
