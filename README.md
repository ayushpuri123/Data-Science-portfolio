This is my Data Science Portfolio, where I do all my AI work, such as

-- Drone Racing Challenge, where I used edge detection to detect the arrows so the  robot could follow them

-- Portfolio 1 is basic cleaning on the e-commerce dataset

-- Portfolio 2 is running a logistic and linear regression on the e-commerce dataset

-- Portfolio 3 is clustering and KNN

-- Cardiovascular disease prediction(portfolio 4), where I ran a machine learning algorithm to predict cardiovascular disease

-- AI Disaster Response, where I ran some genetic algorithms to help a town organise their tools to manage a disaster

-- Comp3410 Assignment 1 is where i run a IDS(Iterative Depth Search) to solve problems
